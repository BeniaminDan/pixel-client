# Project Brief

- **Project:** `pixel_client` — Next.js App Router frontend scaffold.
- **Goal:** Provide a solid baseline (state, hooks, lib utilities, shared types) for the future Pixel client UI so new features can be built quickly.
- **Scope:** Next.js 16 app directory setup, Tailwind 4 styling baseline, shared API client config, Zustand stores, reusable hooks, global types, and supporting developer documentation.
- **Out of Scope (for now):** Backend services, detailed product flows, full design system, deployment hardening beyond the provided Next.js defaults.
