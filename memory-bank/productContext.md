# Product Context

- The Pixel client is currently a lightweight Next.js scaffold with default pages; product flows and UX are not yet defined.
- Intent is to build a reusable front-end foundation (state, hooks, lib utilities, shared types) that future features can plug into.
- User experience goals will emerge later; for now focus on clean developer ergonomics, consistent state handling, and API readiness.
